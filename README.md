# NLI-Measure-Artifact

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to measure the level of annotation artifact based on [ALBERT](https://github.com/google-research/albert) model.

## Files
* h_only_[baseline|sw|mw].py --> measuring annotation artifact of the dataset collected in different conditions.
* h_only_snli[_kaushik].py --> measure annotation artifact of [SNLI](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/snli/) dataset and [counterfactually augmented dataset](https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sklgs0NFvr).

## Reference
I refer to this [blog post](https://mccormickml.com/2019/07/22/BERT-fine-tuning/) by Chris McCormick and Nick Ryan when writing the codes.
